PROGRAMMING EXERCISE
Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graph in computer science. Directed meaning the structure goes one way (there are from and to vertices, conceptually); acyclic meaning there are no loops (if A leads to B, B cannot lead to A).
DAGs are a collection of vertices and edges, which could be represented as simple objects (these classes are just to illustrate, you can use them or define your own):
class Vertex {
long id
}
class Edge {
Vertex from
Vertex to
}
Given a DAG and a vertex, calculate the longest directed path from that vertex. To give the exercise some reference, this was an actual problem encountered in the IPaC program  - showing progress through a variable-length, graph-based questionnaire.
